Portfolio

## Description

I wanted to build a page to work as a portfolio for me; to give a short bio, some contact info, and a showcase of my work so far. This way, there is one webpage that gives access to all of my best work! In building this page, I learned a ton about CSS, and specifically about flexbox and object positioning.
